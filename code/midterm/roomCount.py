#First off, clean up your git! Create a new branch called midterm.  Delete any files and directories associated with other branches so you are only including what is necessary.
#It makes it a lot easier to figure out what is going on.  Don't worry about losing the files. They are stored in the other branch, and you can restore them by switching to that branch.
#Since you have a log folder, I would put the db in there.

#FOR EVERYTHING BELOW I REFER TO THE FIRST AND SECOND SENSORS. THAT DOESN'T REFER TO THE POSITION OF THE SENSORS,
#IT REFERS TO THE ORDER THAT THEY ARE TRIGGERED IN.

#Here is the thing.  This is not going to work so well because both sensors will be triggered regardless of
#If a person is entering or leaving.  It's the order that they are triggered that determines if someone is entering or leaving.
#I would set this up differently. The first thing I would do would be to create a function that is triggereg whenever either sensor goes off,
#and then listens for the second sensor to be triggered. You are also going to need to add a check in there in case the second sensor isn't triggered.
#Something like:

def bothTriggers(trigger2, wait=5):
	timeStamp = False
	#This is the sanity check.  If the second sensor isn't triggered, it resets.
	#The sanity check only happens while the second sensor is in a low state (not triggered)
	timeCheck = time.time()
	while not GPIO.input(trigger2):
		if time.time() - timeCheck > wait:
			break
		continue
    #If the second sensor is triggered, it bypasses the previous if statement and creates the timestamp
    #The it waits for 5 seconds to let the sensors reset. Adjust the sleep timer to the time it takes 
    #for both of your sensors to reset.
		if time.time() - timeCheck <= wait:
			timeStamp = time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
			time.sleep(10)
			continue
#Now you need to rewrite all of this.  You need 2 if statements, one for each sensor.
#When the first sensor is triggered, it should pass the variable for the second sensor's pin.

#let the camera have time to set up
time.sleep(10)
#Set the initial count to zero
roomCount = 0

#Now you need to write all of this.  You need to fill in the 2 if statements, one for each sensor.
#When the first sensor is triggered, it passes the variable for the second sensor's pin to the function that
#listens for both of the triggers.
